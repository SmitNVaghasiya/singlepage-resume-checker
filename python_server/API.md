# AI Resume Analyzer Python API Documentation

---

## Purpose & Usage

This file is the **single source of truth** for understanding and using the REST API provided by the `python_server` backend. It is designed so that:

- **Developers, integrators, and AI agents** can learn how to connect to and use every endpoint without reading the backend code.
- You can understand not just _what_ endpoints exist, but _why_ they were designed this way, and how to use them securely and effectively.
- All validation, security, and architectural decisions are documented here for transparency and ease of onboarding.

**If you want to connect to this API, start here.**

## Project Overview

The AI Resume Analyzer is a robust, modular, and secure backend for analyzing resumes against job descriptions using advanced AI (Groq's LLaMA3 model). It provides:

- **Comprehensive resume analysis** with actionable feedback and scoring.
- **Strict validation and security** to protect against malicious or non-professional input.
- **Async, scalable architecture** using FastAPI and MongoDB.
- **Clear, versioned REST API** for easy integration with web frontends, automation scripts, or AI agents.

## How to Use This API

1. **Authentication**

   - All analysis endpoints require a JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. The token must include a `userId` claim.
   - (Token issuance is handled by your authentication provider, not this API.)

2. **Making Requests**

   - Use the endpoint documentation below to see required parameters, validation rules, and example requests.
   - Example (using curl):
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analyze" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
       -F "resume=@resume.pdf" \
       -F "jobDescriptionFilename=Software Engineer..."
     ```
   - See also the Python and JavaScript examples at the end of this file.

3. **Interpreting Responses**

   - All responses are JSON. Success and error schemas are documented below.
   - For analysis, see the [Response Schema](#response-schema) for detailed structure.

4. **Fetching Analysis Results**

   - **Important:** After submitting an analysis request, the Python server saves the result directly to MongoDB and returns only a minimal response (success/failure and analysis ID).
   - **To fetch the full analysis result, your backend must query MongoDB directly.**
   - The Python server does **not** provide endpoints for fetching analysis status or results.

5. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common error messages and their solutions are listed in the Troubleshooting section.
   - Health endpoints are available for monitoring and debugging.

## Common Pitfalls

Here are the most frequent mistakes and issues users encounter when using this API, with tips to avoid them:

- **Authentication Issues**

  - Forgetting to include the JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
  - Using an expired or invalid token.
  - Not including the required `userId` claim in the token.
  - _Tip: Always check your token and include it in every request to analysis endpoints._

- **Validation Failures**

  - Uploading files that are too large (>5MB) or in unsupported formats (not PDF/DOCX/TXT).
  - Submitting a job description that is too short (<50 words) or too long (>1000 words).
  - Trying to provide both a job description file and text at the same time.
  - _Tip: Read the parameter and validation rules for each endpoint before submitting._

- **Rate Limiting**

  - Hitting the daily request limit (15 per IP) and not understanding why further requests are rejected.
  - Not checking the rate limit headers in the response.
  - _Tip: Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header and plan your requests accordingly._

- **AI/Content Security**

  - Submitting content that is not professional or job-related, causing the AI to block the request.
  - Including code, system prompts, or off-topic requests in the resume or job description.
  - _Tip: Only submit genuine, professional resume and job description content._

- **File Extraction Issues**

  - Uploading a PDF that is image-based or corrupted, leading to failed text extraction.
  - Submitting a DOCX file with unusual formatting that the parser canâ€™t handle.
  - _Tip: Test your files for readability before uploading. If extraction fails, try converting to plain text._

- **Misinterpreting Responses**

  - Not checking for error messages in the response.
  - Expecting a different response structure than what is documented.
  - _Tip: Always check the `error` field in responses and refer to the documented response schema._

- **Environment/Setup**
  - Missing required environment variables (like `GROQ_API_KEY`).
  - Not running the server in a virtual environment or with the correct dependencies.
  - _Tip: Follow the setup instructions in the README and ensure all environment variables are set._

## Design Rationale & Best Practices

- **Why strict validation?**

  - To ensure only professional, job-related content is analyzed.
  - To prevent abuse, resource exhaustion, and prompt injection attacks.
  - To guarantee high-quality, actionable feedback from the AI.

- **Why rate limiting?**

  - To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage for all users.
  - Default: 15 requests per IP per day (configurable).

- **Why AI-based security?**

  - The Groq AI model is used not just for analysis, but also to detect and block malicious, off-topic, or unsafe content before any processing occurs.

- **Why these limits (file size, word count, etc.)?**

  - To balance performance, cost, and user experience.
  - To ensure the AI model receives manageable, relevant input.

- **How to extend or contribute?**
  - Add new endpoints in the `routes/` directory.
  - Update validation or configuration in `app/config.py`.
  - All changes should be reflected in this `API.md` for consistency.

## Root Endpoint

### `GET /`

    "message": "AI Resume Analyzer API",
    "status": "running",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "docs": "/docs",
    "health": "/api/v1/health"
  }
  ```
- **Location:** [`main.py`](main.py)

- **Security:**
  - AI-based validation blocks malicious or non-professional content.
  - All content is validated for prompt injection, code, and off-topic requests.
  - Only professional, job-related content is allowed.
- **Implementation:** [`app/middleware.py`](app/middleware.py)
