## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

#### Create Admin User

Run the following command to create the initial super admin user:

```bash
cd backend
npm run create-admin
```

This will create an admin with the following credentials:

- **Username**: admin
- **Email**: admin@resumechecker.com
- **Password**: Admin@123

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Change the password after first login!

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY NOTE**: Admin accounts cannot be modified through the web interface. All admin account changes must be done through internal organization processes.

#### Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file includes:

```env
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

The admin panel is integrated into the existing login system. Access it at:

- **Login**: Use the regular login page at `/login` with admin credentials
- **Dashboard**: `/admin/dashboard` (redirects automatically after admin login)

### 3. API Endpoints

The admin panel uses the following API endpoints:

#### Authentication

- `POST /api/admin/login` - Admin login
- `GET /api/admin/me` - Get current admin

#### User Management

- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users (with pagination)
- `GET /api/admin/users/:userId` - Get specific user
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:userId/status` - Update user status

#### Analytics

- `GET /api/admin/stats/dashboard` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/admin/stats/analyses` - Analysis statistics
- `GET /api/admin/analyses/:analysisId` - Get specific analysis

#### System Health

- `GET /api/admin/health` - System health check

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control

- Admin panel is completely separate from user authentication
- Uses dedicated admin JWT tokens
- Admin has full system access
- **NEW**: Admin profile access is restricted for enhanced security
- **NEW**: Route-level protection prevents unauthorized access

### 2. Admin Account Security

- **Profile Access**: Admins cannot access user profile pages
- **Password Changes**: Must be done through internal processes
- **Account Deletion**: Cannot be performed through web interface
- **Account Management**: Restricted to organization-level control

### 3. Rate Limiting

- Admin endpoints are rate-limited
- Failed login attempts trigger account lockout
- Session management prevents token hijacking

### 4. Data Protection

- Sensitive user data is protected
- Admin actions are logged for audit trails
- Secure password hashing and validation
- **NEW**: Admin account data is protected from web-based modification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Can't access admin panel**

   - Ensure admin user is created
   - Check JWT_SECRET in environment variables
   - Verify MongoDB connection

2. **Login fails**

   - Check admin credentials
   - Verify account is not locked
   - Check server logs for errors

3. **Data not loading**

   - Check API endpoints are accessible
   - Check network connectivity

4. **Admin redirected from profile page**
   - **Expected behavior**: Admins are automatically redirected to admin dashboard
   - This is a security feature to prevent admin account modification through web interface

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in the backend:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm run dev
```

### Health Checks

Check admin API health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/health
```
