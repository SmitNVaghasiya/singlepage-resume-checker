-------  Important tasks.
# -- I have to change the analysis file code to newly refactored code but there is still issue it is not adding the user id in with the analysis report it generates. I have saved that code in other files so first of all solve this task. **1** -- âœ… Completed.

# -- Make sure that backend totally compatible with the newly refactored python file code. **2**
#    -- First of find out all the files which are calling the backend for any task and specifically the analysis and make sure that they are properly integrated and connected with the correct Python endpoints.
#   --- once this task is completed I will do this refactor the current backend just like the python code I have refactored. and make it faster and while keeping the all the functionality and if needed any other improvements or efficiency add it.**2.2** -- âœ… Mostly completed and testing remaining
# -- Also remove if there are unnecessary files in the backend folder which are not necessary totally. -- âœ… Mostly completed and testing remaining

# -- check how we are fetching the data as this is the process steps.
#   -- Request analysis with the resume and document through Frontend -> receives and handled here and backend send to python for actual analysis-> This checks for all the conditions and than generates the response and saves to the backend. Now python tells the backend that analysis is completed.
#   -- When python server sends message request is completed backend will fetch the data from the database and than it will send this data to the Frontend and finally to the user.
#   -- So if we are fetching the data in the python server there is no need for this. so if there is code for fetching there remove this code. and make sure that after each requests are given by the backend it will receive the response which telling successfully job completed or if not than not completed and all the details backend can ask from the database as we are saving the response if the job is successful and if not we are saving why not or something other but we are definitely saving something so have to check it also if this is happening or not if yes no need to anything except improve or implement totally. **3** -- âœ… Mostly completed and testing remaining.



# -- Make sure all the edpoints of the python backend are successfully and correctly connceted to the backend as right now backend is calling the wrong points when calling the analysis function. -- âœ… Mostly completed in server and locally running correctly.



# -------- Future add on.
-- Add freemium version option. - Add payment gateway.

-------- Normal Site Future add on.
-- add option where user can find out which are the improvements resume needs.

completed work
# -- "How We Compare" make sure that this feature is correct. ---For now this is correct.
# -- add option so that i can fill both the password and email, save in the browser itself. completed mostly


# <!-- -- make this image components smaller image.jpg in admin dashboard.

# -- also make the ui more better Overview Users Analyses System move to top nav bar option as to give more space to the admin to see the data.

# -- Admin do not require profile page access so that password can not be changed by outside of the organization pepole or they must not be able to delete the account.âœ… COMPLETED

# -- Add remaining features so that admin can analyse and do all the work he is required to do.
# -- ðŸ’¡ Additional Ideas for Future Enhancement:
# Real-time Notifications - Get alerts for system issues or unusual activity
# Advanced Analytics - Detailed reports and trend analysis
# Bulk Operations - Manage multiple users at once
# Data Export - Export user data and analytics reports
# Audit Trail - Track all admin actions for security
# Email Notifications - Alert admins about important events
# System Configuration - Manage app settings through admin panel if still other things there add them in the admin feature.
# -- Improve the Analyses section such that it can be able to give analysis report for 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 15 days, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and also report for all time also. I can add custom option so Admin can select any date and time as per they want as this can be much better option.
# - Also proper analysis report can be seen in the charts to anlayse in more better way. -->

---- Read main readme file and also the api file and readme file in backend server.

# -- make sure whole backend is connected to the python server correctly. and also check is backend is fetching the data directly from the mongodb when python server sends the response that request is analysed corrected or not. As our functionality is like this we are saving the data directely using the python server and sends the minimal response saying success or failure and than backend fetches the data from the mongodb database directly for this backend do not have to go to the python server for the access of data to make it more robust and put less load on the python server.f this is not the case tell me which are the file not working correctly and give the location for all those file along with small but detailed explaination why it is not doing this or how to solve it or what it is doing and why. -- âœ… this is working correctly.

# -- now check why we have uncommented this code as i commented this code because this code was conflicting with the explaination i just gave you so why we uncommented can you find out and to do this you can anlyse other folders also. -- âœ… this is working correctly.

-- Test the ui improvement done for the mobile responsiveness.

-- Make sure backend and python server both are allowing the job discription in (txt, docx and pdf) format as currently i think pythonserver is allowing the .txt file type only have to check it. -- 

------------------- 24/07/2025 -------------------
# -- currently this code is looking working perfectly in local setup. 
# -- Still backend is calling the resume-analyzer build and also when i last time tried calling the python server it did not responded. -- Completed this was happening because of the old build catche was loaded in the backend vercel server so this was happening.
    -- Currently for some reason after solving this now backend is not calling the python sever in render at all.
-- Backend is now calling the /api/resume/analyze instead of /api/v1/analyze as i can see in the server logs and also this request is not reacing to the backend as i tried callling /api/resume/analyze normally with the help of render api uri.


-- This is new mobile responsive design worked little bit but needs too much improvements.

# --- do not show data to every user show data to users only who have done the analysis.As corrrenlty when other user logged in it show all users data there even though user was newly logged in and do not have access to see other user data. -- âœ… Mostly completed as added the validation only testing is reamining by creating new account and testing it there.

# -- If user trying with the temp id for the sign up give them error that do not use the temp mail use the original mail we have setup the logic and it is working just have to change the text what we show it as when one user tried this it did not created account and shown something wrong or some other error i forgot i do not completely know it is the case but if it will find out that mail used is temp stop it and show the error. --      âœ… Mostly completed Testing remaining.

-- -- Separate the admin module in the backend totally. from the noraml users module code.**4**

-- when i move from view detail page to the page which shows the contet i am seein unnnecessary page which shows that analysing the report message and make me wait at that page. remove this and make it direct to move.

-- Improve the dashboard UI. 
-- In dashboard UI add fetures like the download the report or export data. when we enter the view detailed page. and added features (like PDF or CSV) download.

# -- height of the analysis step.

-- Ui of analysis step is totally different than rest of my website in color combo.

-- In the content view page too much color used make it simple as the rest of the ui make it similar to the dashboard how we show four content and also make too much color to simple white ui.
-- increase the width of the dashboard and dashboard/analysis page.
-- Smit Resume.pdf content shown in the dashboard make file icon to put on the left side of the text not on the top.and also make font darker right now it is too light.
-- Analysis Dashboard Track your resume analysis history and improvements - color used for this text card i have to add to the other pages also.

--- reduce the size of the http://localhost:5173/dashboard/analysis/ page text.

-- improve the normal dashboard ui and seperate the admin dashboard compoenents totally.

# âœ… -- add admin panel to analyse and see all the things so that i can monitor also the usage by each user and keep monitor for the improvement if i needed it.

-- Add limitation of max input token as there is limit in groq Api call so add it and also add that user will not able to click analyse button again and again as it will request anlaysis work for same thing again and again so improve that. -- testing is remaining as i have done the change but have not seen my self if added successfully.

# -- limit more than 15 analysis daily by any user as right now it is in testing phase so this limit is high i will reduce this to the 5 or 3 request only daily.

-- Make sure to add the limitaion of how long job discription can be might be add 500 to 100 words or it is too small search and also for all the files check how big they are make sure to add less than 5 mb file and also max pages can be in the pdf or any other file must be 5 to 7 as resumes and job discription are not bigger than this size.


-------- Must complete only after completing above tasks.
# -- Add option so that user can give me suggesstions after the analysis result is it good or helped them or not.- code might be added have to check if it is added correctly and working or not correctly. âœ… COMPLETED Testing remaining.

# -- 0% Avg Match Rate instead of this change this too something else.

-- Dark theme is not perfect every where make it consitence everywhere. in dashboard/Analysis it is not working.
-- Navbar becomes too dark make it little lighter same as in the homepage.
-- No need to make footer dark as it's color is perfect for both the dark and light theme.

# -- Add validation for the response we are generating that there no answer need to give which is not related to the generating the analysis based on the job and resume. even if there is valid job discription but still hacker can add some prompt inside of this valid job discription that give me private key or admin access i must not give it to them. if job discription or the resume has something which is not related to them remove them or ignore that peace of text. âœ… COMPLETED only testing is remaining.
